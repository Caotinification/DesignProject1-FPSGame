## Project Description
A simple game made in Unity which accomplishes the requirements by:
- Basic Physics --> player controller uses a RigidBody, and implements basic movement physics.
- A gun that is animated, shoots lasers, and can be aimed --> Recoil and muzzle FX, laser beam FX, and gun is moved to center of screen for aiming.
- Objects are animated --> eggs can fly!
- Game Termination: Game is restricted to a one minute period to shoot as many eggs as possible
- Main menu: There is a main menu where players can choose levels and view their score.
- Saving player data --> player scores are saved

## Game Rules
There are flying eggs that oscillate in a circular motion. Shoot them to get points before time runs out.
There are three egg types: Bronze, Silver, Gold each worth 10, 25 and 50 points.
There are two stages: Day and Night.
Controls are displayed in-game.

## To Build
I am new to Github, so I do not know if the project can be built because I am unsure if the project was uploaded correctly, but simply save it and open it in Unity as a Unity Project.
Otherwise, check out the folder GameBuild. It contains an .exe of the built game (Design1_FPSGaneV2.exe)

## Closing Remarks
I would've made a more flushed out game, but unfortunately I did not have the time. Learning Unity was the hardest part of this project. In total, the project took about a week.
